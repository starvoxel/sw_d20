# SW d20 Character Helper

This is a simple project that will create a (hopefully) simplistic character page helper that would help you:
  - Plan new characters from the ground up
  - Plan the futur of existing characters
  - Explore combinations of species/classes easily without having to do any math yourself!

### Progress
Right now I'm only just starting out.  I have basic data fetching from Google Drive and just a test UI.  I have a [Trello board][trello] where I'll be tracking progress.  This is just a hobby project so progress **will be slow!**
